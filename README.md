# TwitterBot
Simple twitterbot to help expand my ruby knowledge

## Process
https://apps.twitter.com/ to create a new app that can communicate with Twitterâ€™s API.

Called app ruby.tweeter

Filled in application.

Noted Key and Access Tokens.

Installed twitter gem : gem install twitter (didn't work - needed to install devkit first - https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/)

Created bot.rb (source - http://www.codebycodes.com/blog/2015/08/31/creating-a-simeple-twitter-bot-with-ruby/#comment-3361024008) with Key and Access Tokens (didn't work - added VERIFY_NONE code line)

Tweeted my first tweet!
